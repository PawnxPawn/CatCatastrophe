The code is and should be used for learning purposes only. I push you to learn and understand what is happening in the code and try to recreate it yourself.

This code is not my best work due to the fact that this was for a 10-day game jam, and the longer the jam went on, the more shortcuts and sloppy code I wrote. I greatly apologize about this.

If you use the code in any way or form outside of this project, please credit PawnxPawn.

Thank you for your interest in this project.
