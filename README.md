The code is and should be used for learning purposes only I push greatly you learn and understand what is happening in the code and try to recreate it your self.

This code is not my best work due to the fact that this was for a 10 day game jam and longer the jam went on more shortcuts and sloppy code I wrote. I greatly apologize about this.

If you do happen to use the code in anyway or form outside of this project please credit PawnxPawn.

Thank you for your intrest in this project.
